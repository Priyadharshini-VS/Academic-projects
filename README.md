This repository contains datasets used and jupyter notebook files developed for academic projects focused on machine learning. 
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and others. 
The project demonstrates end-to-end implementation of supervised learning techniques on realtime and publicly availble kaggle datasets.
